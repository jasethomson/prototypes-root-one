# Sweet Corner

- This folder contains all resources you will need to complete all 4 Sweet Corner prototypes. Each of them will build upon the work you completed in the last version, so all 4 will be built within this folder. When you are done, you should have one completed page of Sweet Corner and the files necessary to run that version. You will NOT have each individual version separately in this folder, you will continue to use and build upon the files you already have. If you have any questions on this, please reach out to an instructor.

### Assets
